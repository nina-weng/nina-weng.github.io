### About me
I am a second year PhD student working on Algorithmic Fairness in Medical Imaging at Section for Visual Computing (VisComp), Technical University of Denmark (DTU), advised by [Aasa Feragen](https://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~afhar/) and [Siavash Bigdeli](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/sarbi/). 

My research topics include bias assessment and reasoning, counterfactual generation, shortcut learning detection, and bias mitigation. I aim to build fair, transparent, trustworthy, and responsible AI tools. 

### News
- **Aug, 2024**. Our paper, [*Fast Diffusion-Based Counterfactuals for Shortcut Removal and Generation*](https://fastdime.compute.dtu.dk/), has been accepted for an *oral presentation* at [ECCV](https://eccv.ecva.net/)! After a long journey filled with ups and downs, it‚Äôs incredibly rewarding to see our work recognized (so far a bit) by the conference community. Can not wait to present and have (hopefully many!) interesting discussions in Milan this September üçï
- **Aug, 2024**. After [more than one-year's procrastination](./img/news/pw_pro.png), I finally recreated my personal webpage (this one!). I used [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to build it -- it's incredibly simple and includes the function to integrate code into the blogs, which I‚Äôm looking forward to trying out in a near (!) future.
