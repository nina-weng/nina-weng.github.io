### About me
I am a second year PhD student working on Algorithmic Fairness in Medical Imaging at Section for Visual Computing (VisComp), Technical University of Denmark (DTU), advised by [Aasa Feragen](https://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~afhar/) and [Siavash Bigdeli](https://people.compute.dtu.dk/sarbi/). 

My research topics include bias assessment and reasoning, counterfactual generation, shortcut learning detection, and bias mitigation. I aim to build fair, transparent, trustworthy, and responsible AI tools.
