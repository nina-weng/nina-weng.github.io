I aim to build fair, transparent, trustworthy, and responsible AI tools.\n\n\nNews\n\nAug, 2024. Our paper, Fast Diffusion-Based Counterfactuals for Shortcut Removal and Generation, has been accepted for an oral presentation at ECCV! After a long journey filled with ups and downs, it‚Äôs incredibly rewarding to see our work recognized (so far a bit) by the conference community. Can not wait to present and have (hopefully many!) interesting discussions in Milan this September üçï\nAug, 2024. After more than one-year‚Äôs procrastination, I finally recreated my personal webpage (this one!). I used Quarto to build it ‚Äì it‚Äôs incredibly simple and includes the function to integrate code into the blogs, which I‚Äôm looking forward to trying out in a near (!) future."
