    "section": "",
    "text": "Motivation: why I started to be interested about this\n2 weeks ago, I attended the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) in Milan. I was very surprised how exciting a conference could be, as this was the first top-tier, large conference I had ever attended. The excitement came from many aspects, some of which were beyond my expectations.\nI wrote a LinkedIn post to share some of my personal ‘awards’ for ECCV this year, which included quite a few surprises I encountered at the conference. You can read it at this link;)\nAmong all of these, I was particularly surprised by how fantastic the experience was during the poster sessions – that I ended up stopping going to any oral but only attending poster session, with each for more than 3 hours. Whenever I spotted something related to my interests, I noticed that the posters very close by (poster number \\(\\pm\\) 3) were very likely to be on the same topic.Additionally, posters nearby, at a slightly farther distance but not too far away (poster number \\(\\pm\\) 10 ~ 15), might not have the same keywords but could still be highly relevant to my interests, meaning that they shared similarities in research direction beyond mere keyword overlap.\nThis fact intrigued me so much – hhow do they manage to sequence the posters so that they are clustered around those with similar topics?\nAs I was really curious about how they did it, I thought about asking people on the committee, but I failed because I didn’t know who to reach out to. When I presented this finding in our section meeting, my colleagues mentioned that it was done using 1-D t-SNE of the paper embeddings at CVPR this year (as mentioned by Morten). At ECCV, I didn’t see or hear any information about it, but I assumed a similar approach was applied. My colleagues also mentioned that they might have used the track information collected during the submission phase.\n\n\nProblem definition\n\nTo better define the problem, I would like to write down a more precise description as followed.\nGiven a set of documents \\(D = \\{f\\}_{i=1}^n\\), where each document \\(f_i\\) contains multiple pieces of information, that \\(f_i = \\{a_{f_i}, b_{f_i}, c_{f_i}, ...\\}\\) (in practice, we might concatenate all information into a single string, but here, I aim for a more general formulation), our goal is to determine a sequence of \\(D\\), denoted as \\(S = k_1, k_2, ...\\), where \\(k\\) is the index of the original file index. This yields a document sequence \\(S_f =  {f_{k_1},f_{k_2},…}\\), where:\n\nThe closer two files are in the sequence, the more similar they should be w.r.t research topics;\nConsidering the hierarchical relationship between broad and narrow topics (e.g., algorithmic fairness as a broader topic and a specific bias mitigation method as a more specialized topic), broader topics should be prioritized, and the sequence should not switch back and forth between broad and narrow topics. E.g. it is preferable to have A1-A2-A3-3B-2B-1B, rather then A1-B1-B2-A2-A3-B3, assuming the A represents broader topic in this scenario, and numbers denote more specific subtopics;\n(optional) If the layout of the physical position of the document is given, it will be preferably that the physical position are also taking into account (this will make this problem much harder so therefore are discarded in this post).\n\n\n\nA simple solution based on OpenAI API\nA straight forward idea will be using the embeddings of the documents from pre-trained foundation models. Of course there might be some limitations of such, which we will discuss in the following result section. However, this is the most effortless way of doing so, so here we go:\n\nGet the title and abstract of all papers from ECCV from the webpage;\nGet the embeddings of them from OpenAI API. Here I choose the model text-embedding-3-small(for more details of this model please refer to OpenAI document) which return a vector of size 1536;\nDimensional reduction and visualise the embeddings;\nDefine a similarity score and start the interesting part of this project :) For simplicity, I used cosine similarity, as it works best for sparse vectors, just like in this case (we have around 2,300 data points, each represented by a 1536-dimensional vector).\n\nBy which you can now find papers that are closer to your specified one in the embedding space. I used my own paper - Fast Diffusion-Based Counterfactuals for Shortcut Removal and Generation - as an example, and here are the results:\n\n\nResults using FastDiME as an example\n\n\n\ntop 10 similar papers w.r.t FastDiME\n\n\nWhich is surprisingly good, 4 out of the top 5 results are posters that I stopped by during the poster session and actually discussed with their main authors (except for the LCM paper). Among the top 10 papers, there are 6 that I found particularly relevant. Additionally, the 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 9th papers are content-wise very close to ours.\nThe real question is how to build the sequence for the poster exhibition. I implemented a simple greedy approach, and here is the result showing the top 20 points of the path starting from FastDiME (you can zoom in for easier navigation).\n\n\nFrom this, we can observe that the results are not ideal. Since the algorithm is too greedy, it tends to prioritize papers with more similarities in smaller aspects, such as wording and dataset, rather than broader research topics similarities like image generation (instead of video generation) or shortcut problems (instead of generic cases).\nFor example, the third point already shifts the focus to text-to-image generation (Point3: Improving text-guided object inpainting with semantic pre-inpainting). Though the scope is still in image editing, our approach does not use text prompts, making it significantly different from theirs. Point 4, 5, 6, and 7 all fall within the text-to-image generation range. However, starting from Point 8, the reseach topic jumps again, from image generation to video generation, and later to 3D generation or scene rendering.\n\n\nTake-away messgaes\n\nIt’s an interesting question (or algorithmic challenge?) to determine how to sequence posters in a conference setting so that similar papers are clustered in physical space, enhancing the experience for conference participants.\nThis can be simply (though not ideally) addressed by retrieving text embeddings of the paper collection from platforms like the OpenAI API.\nI would love to hear about other solutions! If anyone is interested in such algorithms—especially approaches that incorporate the venue floor plan—it would be amazing! Please drop me an email if you come across anything relevant.\n\n\n\nMore to read\nOf course, many people have tackled the challenge of identifying what to read among the vast number of papers published daily, especially in AI-related fields. Here are some notable efforts: - Scholar inbox, though it does not seem to be open-sourced.\n\n\nCredits\nThe implementation is based on Miguel González Duque’s amazing hackathon project for MLLS 2024 retreat. Here is the link to the original project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A beginner-friendly guide to using FairLearn for evaluating bias in image classification tasks and applying simple post-hoc mitigation methods. This comes as a course exercise from the RAI course (02517 - Responsible AI: Algorithmic Fairness and Explainability) at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).\n\nThe toturial of using FairLearn for image classification task\nYou can also access the .ipynb file from here.\n\n\n\n\nSome final remarks\n\nFairlearn is not designed for image-based tasks, which makes its implementation cumbersome. A new Python-based package from the University of Oxford might be a good alternative: OxonFair. While I have not personally tested it, I encourage anyone interested in an easier approach to fairness assessment to give it a try.\nFor those exploring algorithmic fairness, especially in bias mitigation, I personally recommend avoiding excessive reliance on existing packages. This might be a biased opinion, but in my experience, while these tools offer many options, they often obscure the underlying mechanisms. It is easy to get caught up in hyperparameter tuning rather than developing a deep understanding of how bias manifests in the data.\nThat said, I recognize the value of these packages for those who need a quick and structured way to evaluate model fairness with minimal effort.\nBias mitigation without understanding the root cause of bias is often ineffective. I recommend reading the following two papers for deeper insights:\n\nImproving the Fairness of Chest X-ray Classifiers.\nTL;DR: Among various bias mitigation techniques, simple data balancing—despite being the most basic—consistently proves to be the most effective. This highlights that attempting to mitigate bias without first identifying its root cause is often futile.\nAre Sex-Based Physiological Differences the Cause of Gender Bias for Chest X-Ray Diagnosis?.\nTL;DR: Gender-based performance disparities in chest X-ray diagnosis are not primarily due to physiological differences but are more likely caused by variations in label error rates between genders. This finding suggests that mitigation strategies focusing solely on gender may divert efforts away from addressing the actual sources of bias."

Baumgartner and work with his team. This is my second time living in Switzerland—what a destiny! :)\nOct, 2024. Manxi and I presented our paper Shortcut Learning in Medical Image Segmentation at MICCAI 2024 in Morocco. Together with Aasa, Tareen and many others, we also successfully organized the FAIMI workshop (again;) there.  This is the first time MICCAI was held in Africa – a milestone worth celebrating. Yet, knowing that only 40 out of 2,869 papers were submitted by Africa-based institutes was a stark reminder of the deep global disparities in research participation. Progress toward true inclusivity in science is still a long, long journey to go..\nSep, 2024. Our paper, Fast Diffusion-Based Counterfactuals for Shortcut Removal and Generation (co-first-author with Paraskevas), has been accepted for an oral presentation at ECCV! After a long journey filled with ups and downs, it’s incredibly rewarding to see our work recognized (so far a bit) by the conference community. Can not wait to present and have (hopefully many!) interesting discussions in Milan this September 🍕\nAug, 2024. After more than one-year’s procrastination, I finally recreated my personal webpage (this one!). I used Quarto to build it – it’s incredibly simple and includes the function to integrate code into the blogs, which I’m looking forward to trying out in a near (!) future."
